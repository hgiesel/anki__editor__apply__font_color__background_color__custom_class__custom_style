This add-on allows you to quickly set a font color, the background color or a a custom class or custom style. You can use shortcuts, buttons from the top of the editor or the context menu. 

The latest version of this add-on and this description only refers to Anki 2.1. An old version for 2.0 is still available under this ID since I can't remove the old version. I have stopped using Anki 2.0 so there's no support. Don't download this add-on for 2.0.

The configuration of this add-on was changed with the release 0.3 from July 2019. Now you can use a configuration menu. This new version tries to read your old config.

If you just want to sometimes change the text color or background color this add-on might be overkill. Or maybe you find the config too complicated. Or maybe you run into an error with this add-on. Then you could have a look at these options:
- The option to change the background color is available in the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/295889520" rel="nofollow">Mini Format Pack</a>. But switching between different colors is time consuming.
- Anki has a function to change the font color. But switching between different colors is time consuming.
- There's the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2491935955" rel="nofollow">Quick Colour Changing</a> that allows to set shortcuts for different font colors.


<b># applying different font size </b>
You could use a class and put "font-size:30px;" into the field "styling of class".
